Two simple DSMLs for exercising M2M transformations in ETL.

### Using the repository

There are two ways to do this activity:

1. You can check out the repository and import the projects into Eclipse, then do the activity there. More information about checking out and editing code in Eclipse can be found on KEATS.
2. You can do this activity in your browser.

   Due to an annoying, long-standing GitHub Classroom bug, you need a small extra step for this:

    1. Copy the URL of your repository (see the location bar of your browser).
    2. Open [this form](https://7ccsmmdd.github.io/) and paste your repository URL into the corresponding field.
    3. The URL field should fill with a long complicated URL as soon as you move out of the text field. 
    4. Click on the button at the bottom of the form to open that URL in a new tab: this is the MDENet Education Platform with the activity pre-loaded.
